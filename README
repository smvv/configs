Collection of various configuration files used on my systems.

Being tired of duplicating my carefully configured applications, I started this
Git repository to be able to easily share and maintain my configuration files
across multiple systems or system types.

Even though both machine have completely different hardware, I use most of my
software on both machines:

 - Awesome      window manager
 - Vim          advanced text editor
 - Chromium     web browser

For now, I have added the configuration files of two different computer
profiles:

  +----------+-------------+--------+
  | Nickname | Profile     | Screen |
  +----------+-------------+--------+
  | Gentosis | Netbook     | 10.1"  |
  | Deleuze  | Workstation | 27"    |
  +----------+-------------+--------+

Installation:

Configure your computer using one of the following configuration groups:
{netbook, workstation}. For example, I'll use "netbook" as profile for
computers with a small screen:

$ ./config netbook
